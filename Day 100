There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children



    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector <int> candies(n , 1);
        for(int i =1; i < n; i++){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] && candies[i] <= candies[i-1]){
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }
        for(int i = n-2; i >=0; i--){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] && candies[i] <= candies[i+1]){
                candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1;
            }
        }
        int totalCandies = 0;
        for(int val : candies){
            totalCandies += val;
        }
        return totalCandies;
    }
