You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Answer:-

int climbStairs(int n) {
    if(n <= 2) return n;
    
    int first =1;
    int second =2;

    for(int i =3; i <=n; i++) {
        int current = first + second;
        first = second;
        second = current;
    }

    return second;
}
