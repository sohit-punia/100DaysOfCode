Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

Answer:-

   int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x < 2){
            return x;
        }
        int low = 1;
        int high = x / 2;
        int ans = 0;

        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if(mid <= x / mid){
                ans = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;

    }
