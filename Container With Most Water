  Q11 Container With Most Water:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.


Answer:-

    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int s = 0; // start
        int e =  height.size() -1; //end
        int area;
        int maxarea = 0;
        while(s<e){
            area = min(height[s] , height[e])* (e -s);
            if(area > maxarea) maxarea = area;
            if(min(height[s] , height[e]) == height[s]) s++;
            else e--;
        }
        return maxarea;
        
    }
